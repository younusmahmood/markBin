# markBin

Simple web app built with React + Meteor that allows you to create your own user, make your own Bin and write markdown HTML just
like this github readME, and then translates it into HTML on the screen for the users to see. Also allows you to create a bin and share it with other users along with live editing. If two windows are open, and one account is typing in the shared bin the other automatically sees it coming up on theirs as well.
